<h1>JJ's Flick Picks</h1>
<h2>Some Sick Cinema</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bottoms</h3>
<p>To be honest I only picked this because it's the most recent movies I've watched but I did genuinely enjoy it a lot!</p>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>This was the last movie I saw in theaters before COVID, and it's fantastic if a little spooky!</p>
<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>This is even spookier, guess it's on the brain for October, but the music is INCREDIBLE!</p>
